In MySQL's Performance Schema, instruments represent various activities or events within the MySQL server that can be monitored or measured. These instruments provide a way to collect detailed information about the internal workings of the database, aiding in performance analysis and optimization. Here are some common Performance Schema instruments along with brief explanations:

1. **Wait Events:**
   - Instruments related to waiting events, capturing information about threads waiting for specific conditions.

   Examples:
   - `wait/io/table/sql/handler`: Wait for a table handler lock.
   - `wait/synch/mutex/sql/THD::LOCK_thd_data`: Wait for a THD data structure mutex.

2. **Statement Execution Events:**
   - Instruments related to the execution of SQL statements.

   Examples:
   - `statement/sql/select`: Execute a SELECT statement.
   - `statement/sql/insert`: Execute an INSERT statement.

3. **Stage Events:**
   - Instruments related to various stages of query execution.

   Examples:
   - `stage/sql/starting`: The starting stage of query execution.
   - `stage/sql/executing`: The executing stage of query execution.

4. **Memory Events:**
   - Instruments related to memory allocation and deallocation.

   Examples:
   - `memory/sql/malloc`: Memory allocation in SQL code.
   - `memory/sql/free`: Memory deallocation in SQL code.

5. **File I/O Events:**
   - Instruments related to file input/output operations.

   Examples:
   - `file/sql/FRM::fseek`: File seek operation in SQL code.
   - `file/sql/FRM::fread`: File read operation in SQL code.

6. **Locking Events:**
   - Instruments related to locks and lock-related activities.

   Examples:
   - `wait/lock/table/sql/innodb`: Wait for an InnoDB table lock.
   - `wait/lock/metadata/sql/mdl`: Wait for a metadata lock.

7. **Transaction Events:**
   - Instruments related to transaction-related activities.

   Examples:
   - `transaction/sql/commit`: SQL commit operation.
   - `transaction/sql/rollback`: SQL rollback operation.

8. **Connection Events:**
   - Instruments related to connection handling.

   Examples:
   - `connection/sql/alloc`: Allocate a connection in SQL.
   - `connection/sql/free`: Free a connection in SQL.

To query for available instruments, you can use the `performance_schema.setup_instruments` table. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments;
```

This will show a list of available instruments along with their names, enabled status, and other details.

Remember that the availability of instruments may vary depending on your MySQL version and configuration. Always refer to the documentation for your specific MySQL version to get accurate information about Performance Schema instruments.
