The `sys` schema in MySQL 8 is a collection of views, procedures, and functions that provide a high-level, user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing the MySQL server. It is designed to simplify the process of collecting and interpreting performance-related information. Here are some key components of the `sys` schema and their use case examples:

### 1. **host_summary_by_statement_latency:**
   - Provides a summary of SQL statements.
   - Useful for identifying high-load or resource-intensive queries.

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM host_summary_by_statement_latency LIMIT 10;
   ```

### 2. **sys.statement_analysis:**
   - Provides detailed analysis for a specific SQL statement.
   - Helpful for understanding the execution plan and optimizing queries.

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sys.statement_analysis WHERE digest = 'your_query_digest';
   ```

### 3. **sys.processlist:**
   - Similar to `SHOW PROCESSLIST` but with additional information.
   - Useful for monitoring currently executing threads.

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sys.processlist;
   ```

### 4. **sys.schema_object_overview:**
   - Provides an overview of schema objects and their details.
   - Useful for understanding the distribution of data across tables.

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sys.schema_object_overview;
   ```

### 5. **sys.metrics:**
   - Collects metrics related to InnoDB.
   - Useful for monitoring InnoDB performance and identifying bottlenecks.

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sys.metrics ORDER BY Variable_name;
   ```

### 6. **sys.memory_summary_global_by_event_name:**
   - Summarizes memory usage by event name.
   - Useful for identifying memory-intensive operations.

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sys.memory_global_total ;
   SELECT * FROM sys.memory_by_user_by_current_bytes ;
   ```

### 7. **sys.x$wait_classes_global_by_avg_latency:**
   - Provides information about wait events and their average latency.
   - Useful for identifying areas of contention and improving performance.

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sys.x$wait_classes_global_by_avg_latency ORDER BY avg_latency DESC;
   ```

### 8. **sys.version:**
   - Displays information about the MySQL server version.

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sys.version;
   ```

### 9. **sys.metrics:**
   - Provides a variety of metrics about server performance.
   - Useful for monitoring key performance indicators.

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sys.metrics ORDER BY Variable_name DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

These are just a few examples of the many views and procedures available in the `sys` schema. The `sys` schema is a powerful tool for database administrators and developers to monitor, analyze, and optimize MySQL performance. Use cases may vary depending on the specific needs of your application and the characteristics of your MySQL deployment.
